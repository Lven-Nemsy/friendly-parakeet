# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

This Password Generator was created to work and practice on Javascript.
- What was your motivation? To improve myself.
- Why did you build this project? To understand the for loops and random better.
- What problem does it solve? It generates a password randomly based on selected criteria.
- What did you learn? How complicated a simple thing as a password generator can be! I'm still havcing difficulty with looping.

## Usage

To use this Password Generator click on 'Generate Password'. Prompts and comfirmation messages will appear asking what to be included in the password. When completed the website should populate a password. I'm currently having issues with that portion and will resubmit in the future. It either repeats back the first character in the sequence or pops up blank and shows up in the console. I have yet to figure out a proper loop for it to repeat as many character as submitted in the prompt.
